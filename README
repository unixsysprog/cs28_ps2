Summary:

  This submission contains the files:

    Makefile    -- the makefile
    Plan        -- a description of the design and operation of my code
    typescript  -- a sample run

    main.c      -- main entry point to the tarc command
    tarc.h      -- header files of the tarc command, mostly has definitions
                   exposes tar_it and pad_file functions

Notes:
  Was tested to handle cases of directories, files, symlinks, and hidden files.
  Will also handle invalid command line inputs and and will error out if file 
  permissions do not allow for reading.
